Leetcode can be an excellent resource for practicing for interviews. Not only are the algorithms and use cases of data structures in themselves useful to get familiar with, but these challenges often push you to find efficient ways to use the language of your choice.

Are all technical interviews similar to leetcode? No. In fact, as someone not interviewing at big, competitive companies like Google or Amazon, only about 30% of my interviews have been based on Leetcode questions. And of those 30%, they haven't been straight up leetcode - platforms like HackerRank or Codesignal will give you flurry of questions to answer in 1-2 hours, and they are usually a mix of easy to medium leetcode questions wrapped in slightly more OOP or ETL-related scenarios that have a little bit more to do with more practical programming skills like

- error handling
- using algos like binary search within a real-world context
- data transformations
- lots of data transformations
- state management! Which is to say, state management under pressure.

For lack of another term, I've started to call these types of challenges business problems since they seem to be a specific category of coding challenges, like leetcode is, even though they are a bit harder to define.

In an effort to define them and to start compiling a list of them, I've started this repo.

It's a mix of questions I've received in real interviews and ones I've asked chatbots for. I hope it's helpful!

# Reaching out to people to find Bizprobs
I've found a really great way to find these types of problems is to reach out to engineers you admire and have been through an interview or two and just ask if they know of a good (n)minute problem they've encountered or administered in an interview before. You can get some really creative and relevant answers, and sometimes they even have a repo already set up with the problem, some sample data etc. This is the origin of about 40% of the challenges in this repo.

# Using ChatGPT to generate Bizprobs
This ALSO works really well. What I have generally done is just copy and paste the job description for a role and tell an LLM "Yo can you think up a 40 minute interview question that this company might give?" Credit to Eric Hayes for this approach. This is the origin of about 60% of the challenges in this repo.

# Disclaimers
- I don't guarantee correctness of any code here. A good deal of these results have just been copied and pasted in here, many of them from chatbots.
