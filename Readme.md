Leetcode can be an excellent resource for practicing for interviews. Not only are the algorithms and use cases of data structures in themselves useful to get familiar with, but these challenges often push you to find efficient ways to use the language of your choice.

Are all technical interviews similar to leetcode? No. In fact, as someone not interviewing at big, competitive companies like Google or Amazon, only about 30% of my interviews have been based on Leetcode questions. And of those 30%, they haven't been straight up leetcode - platforms like HackerRank or Codesignal will give you flurry of questions to answer in 1-2 hours, and they are usually a mix of easy to medium leetcode questions wrapped in slightly more OOP or ETL-related scenarios that have a little bit more to do with more practical programming skills like

- error handling
- using algos like binary search within a real-world context
- data transformations
- lots of data transformations
- state management! Which is to say, state management under pressure.

For lack of another term, I've started to call these types of challenges business problems since they seem to be a specific category of coding challenges, like leetcode is, even though they are a bit harder to define.

In an effort to define them and to start compiling a list of them, I've started this repo.

It's a mix of questions I've recieved in real interviews and ones I've asked chatbots for. I hope it's helpful!
